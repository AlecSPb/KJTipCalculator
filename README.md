KJ Tip Calculator
=================

This is a simple iOS tip calculator app, thrown together in a few hours as an experiment in using Swift and in using frameworks in iOS.

The embedded KJNumericText framework contain functions and classes related to conversions between text and numeric values that may be useful in other apps.
