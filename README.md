KJ Tip Calculator
=================

> **Important note:** Xcode 6 beta 3 apparently can't build apps that use embedded frameworks, so KJTipCalculator cannot be built with it. See <https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/KJTipCalculator/issues/1> for details.

This is a simple iOS tip calculator app, thrown together in a few hours as an experiment in using Swift and in creating frameworks in iOS.

The embedded KJNumericText framework contain functions and classes related to conversions between text and numeric values that may be useful in other apps.

Requires Xcode 6 and iOS 8.
